Wanted to learn more about all things microservices, so here are some fun little learning projects.

### Build the images
Run ./build.sh

### Run the images
But only one at a time! Sample usage in subsequent readme files.
 - docker run -d -p 80:80 flask-app
 - docker run -d -p 80:80 flask-rest
 - docker run -d -p 80:80 gamut-basic
